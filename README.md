# Huffman-Shannon_fano
# Aim:
Consider a discrete memoryless source with symbols and statistics {0.125, 0.0625, 0.25, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.125, 0.25} for its output. 
Apply the Huffman and Shannon-Fano to this source. 
Show that by drawing the tree diagram, and 
Calculate the average code word length, entropy, variance, redundancy, and efficiency.
